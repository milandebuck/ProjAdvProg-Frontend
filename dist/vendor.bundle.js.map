This has important implications for animations and any stateful\n\t     * controls\n\t     * (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can be\n\t     * animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state such\n\t     * as user input.\n\t     *\n\t     * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.\n\t     * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that\n\t     * RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the second response will produce objects with\n\t     * different identities, and Angular will tear down the entire DOM and rebuild it (as if all old\n\t     * elements were deleted and all new elements inserted). This is an expensive operation and should\n\t     * be avoided if possible.\n\t     *\n\t     * To customize the default tracking algorithm, `NgFor` supports `trackBy` option.\n\t     * `trackBy` takes a function which has two arguments: `index` and `item`.\n\t     * If `trackBy` is given, Angular tracks changes by the return value of the function.\n\t     *\n\t     * ### Syntax\n\t     *\n\t     * - `<li *ngFor=\"let item of items; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n\t     * - `<li template=\"ngFor let item of items; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n\t     *\n\t     * With `<template>` element:\n\t     *\n\t     * ```\n\t     * <template ngFor let-item [ngForOf]=\"items\" let-i=\"index\" [ngForTrackBy]=\"trackByFn\">\n\t     *   <li>...</li>\n\t     * </template>\n\t     * ```\n\t     *\n\t     * ### Example\n\t     *\n\t     * See a [live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/KVuXxDp0qinGDyo307QW?p=preview) for a more detailed\n\t     * example.\n\t     *\n\t     * @stable\n\t     */\n\t    var NgFor = (function () {\n\t        function NgFor(_viewContainer, _template, _differs, _cdr) {\n\t            this._viewContainer = _viewContainer;\n\t            this._template = _template;\n\t            this._differs = _differs;\n\t            this._cdr = _cdr;\n\t            this._differ = null;\n\t        }\n\t        Object.defineProperty(NgFor.prototype, \"ngForTemplate\", {\n\t            set: function (value) {\n\t                if (value) {\n\t                    this._template = value;\n\t                }\n\t            },\n\t            enumerable: true,\n\t            configurable: true\n\t        });\n\t        NgFor.prototype.ngOnChanges = function (changes) {\n\t            if ('ngForOf' in changes) {\n\t                // React on ngForOf changes only once all inputs have been initialized\n\t                var value = changes['ngForOf'].currentValue;\n\t                if (!this._differ && value) {\n\t                    try {\n\t                        this._differ = this._differs.find(value).create(this._cdr, this.ngForTrackBy);\n\t                    }\n\t                    catch (e) {\n\t                        throw new Error(\"Cannot find a differ supporting object '\" + value + \"' of type '\" + getTypeNameForDebugging(value) + \"'.

In other words, if a transition is\n     * defined that\n     * matches the old/current state criteria then the associated animation will be triggered.\n     *\n     * ```typescript\n     * // all transition/state changes are defined within an animation trigger\n     * trigger(\"myAnimationTrigger\", [\n     *   // if a state is defined then its styles will be persisted when the\n     *   // animation has fully completed itself\n     *   state(\"on\", style({ background: \"green\" })),\n     *   state(\"off\", style({ background: \"grey\" })),\n     *\n     *   // a transition animation that will be kicked off when the state value\n     *   // bound to \"myAnimationTrigger\" changes from \"on\" to \"off\"\n     *   transition(\"on => off\", animate(500)),\n     *\n     *   // it is also possible to do run the same animation for both directions\n     *   transition(\"on <=> off\", animate(500)),\n     *\n     *   // or to define multiple states pairs separated by commas\n     *   transition(\"on => off, off => void\", animate(500)),\n     *\n     *   // this is a catch-all state change for when an element is inserted into\n     *   // the page and the destination state is unknown\n     *   transition(\"void => *\", [\n     *     style({ opacity: 0 }),\n     *     animate(500)\n     *   ]),\n     *\n     *   // this will capture a state change between any states\n     *   transition(\"* => *\", animate(\"1s 0s\")),\n     * ])\n     * ```\n     *\n     * The template associated with this component will make use of the `myAnimationTrigger`\n     * animation trigger by binding to an element within its template code.\n     *\n     * ```html\n     * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->\n     * <div [@myAnimationTrigger]=\"myStatusExp\">...</div>\n     * ```\n     *\n     * #### The final `animate` call\n     *\n     * If the final step within the transition steps is a call to `animate()` that **only**\n     * uses a timing value with **no style data** then it will be automatically used as the final\n     * animation\n     * arc for the element to animate itself to the final state. This involves an automatic mix of\n     * adding/removing CSS styles so that the element will be in the exact state it should be for the\n     * applied state to be presented correctly.\n     *\n     * ```\n     * // start off by hiding the element, but make sure that it animates properly to whatever state\n     * // is currently active for \"myAnimationTrigger\"\n     * transition(\"void => *\", [\n     *   style({ opacity: 0 }),\n     *   animate(500)\n     * ])\n     * ```\n     *\n     * ### Transition Aliases (`:enter` and `:leave`)\n     *\n     * Given that enter (insertion) and leave (removal) animations are so common,\n     * the `transition` function accepts both `:enter` and `:leave` values which\n     * are aliases for the `void => *` and `* => void` state changes.\n     *\n     * ```\n     * transition(\":enter\", [\n     *   style({ opacity: 0 }),\n     *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))\n     * ])\n     * transition(\":leave\", [\n     *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 0 }))\n     * ])\n     * ```\n     *\n     * ### Example ([live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/Kez8XGWBxWue7qP7nNvF?p=preview))\n     *\n     * {@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n     *\n     * @experimental Animation support is experimental.\n     */\n    function transition(stateChangeExpr, steps) {\n        var animationData = Array.isArray(steps) ? new AnimationSequenceMetadata(steps) : steps;\n        return new AnimationStateTransitionMetadata(stateChangeExpr, animationData);\n    }\n    /**\n     * `trigger` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular2's\n     * animation\n     * DSL language.

a template once per item from an iterable. The context for\n     * each instantiated template inherits from the outer context with the given loop variable set\n     * to the current item from the iterable.\n     *\n     * ### Local Variables\n     *\n     * `NgFor` provides several exported values that can be aliased to local variables:\n     *\n     * * `index` will be set to the current loop iteration for each template context.\n     * * `first` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the first one in the\n     *   iteration.\n     * * `last` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the last one in the\n     *   iteration.\n     * * `even` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an even index.\n     * * `odd` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an odd index.\n     *\n     * ### Change Propagation\n     *\n     * When the contents of the iterator changes, `NgFor` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:\n     *\n     * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.\n     * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.\n     * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.\n     * * Otherwise, the DOM element for that item will remain the same.\n     *\n     * Angular uses object identity to track insertions and deletions within the iterator and reproduce\n     * those changes in the DOM. This has important implications for animations and any stateful\n     * controls\n     * (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can be\n     * animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state such\n     * as user input.\n     *\n     * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.\n     * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that\n     * RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the second response will produce objects with\n     * different identities, and Angular will tear down the entire DOM and rebuild it (as if all old\n     * elements were deleted and all new elements inserted). This is an expensive operation and should\n     * be avoided if possible.\n     *\n     * To customize the default tracking algorithm, `NgFor` supports `trackBy` option.\n     * `trackBy` takes a function which has two arguments: `index` and `item`.\n     * If `trackBy` is given, Angular tracks changes by the return value of the function.\n     *\n     * ### Syntax\n     *\n     * - `<li *ngFor=\"let item of items; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n     * - `<li template=\"ngFor let item of items; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n     *\n     * With `<template>` element:\n     *\n     * ```\n     * <template ngFor let-item [ngForOf]=\"items\" let-i=\"index\" [ngForTrackBy]=\"trackByFn\">\n     *   <li>...</li>\n     * </template>\n     * ```\n     *\n     * ### Example\n     *\n     * See a [live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/KVuXxDp0qinGDyo307QW?p=preview) for a more detailed\n     * example.\n     *\n     * @stable\n     */\n    var NgFor = (function () {\n        function NgFor(_viewContainer, _template, _differs, _cdr) {\n            this._viewContainer = _viewContainer;\n            this._template = _template;\n            this._differs = _differs;\n            this._cdr = _cdr;\n            this._differ = null;\n        }\n        Object.defineProperty(NgFor.prototype, \"ngForTemplate\", {\n            set: function (value) {\n                if (value) {\n                    this._template = value;\n                }\n            },\n            enumerable: true,\n            configurable: true\n        });\n        NgFor.prototype.ngOnChanges = function (changes) {\n            if ('ngForOf' in changes) {\n                // React on ngForOf changes only once all inputs have been initialized\n                var value = changes['ngForOf'].currentValue;\n                if (!this._differ && value) {\n                    try {\n                        this._differ = this._differs.find(value).create(this._cdr, this.ngForTrackBy);\n                    }\n                    catch (e) {\n                        throw new Error(\"Cannot find a differ supporting object '\" + value + \"' of type '\" + getTypeNameForDebugging(value) + \"'.
